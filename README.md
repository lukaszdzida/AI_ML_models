# AI Machine Learning models

Hello World! It is my first repository, so I encourage you to share your thoughts, and comments.

I hope you find  something interesting for you as well in the topics below.

### NOTE

I'd like to mention that the models have been crated in Jupiter Notebook in Azure Machine Learning Studio mainly in Python3.10 - AzureML Karnel.

For deep learning models I used Python3.10 - Pytorch and Tensorflow Karnel, and cleared output from most computational expensive for the cost-saving reasons.
