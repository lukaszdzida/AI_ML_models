    "    Linear regression (for regression)\n",
    "Linear regression is one of the simplest and most interpretable regression algorithms. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable. The algorithm fits a line (or hyperplane) to the data that minimizes the difference between the predicted and actual outputs. Linear regression is easy to implement and works well for simple, linear relationships."

    "Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm commonly used for binary classification tasks. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class (e.g., spam or not spam) using a logistic function. Logistic regression is widely used because it’s easy to interpret and performs well for linearly separable data."

    "Decision trees are versatile algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by splitting the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure where each node represents a decision. Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, but they can overfit the data if not properly controlled (e.g., through pruning)."

The algorithm tries to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the data points from different classes. SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces, making them useful for complex classification tasks."

It’s nonparametric, meaning it doesn’t make assumptions about the data distribution. You can use k-NN for both classification and regression, but the algorithm can become computationally expensive as the dataset grows."

By averaging the results of multiple trees, random forests reduce the risk of overfitting and increase robustness. They are widely used for both classification and regression tasks due to their high performance and flexibility."
