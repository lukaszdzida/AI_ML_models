    "\tk-means clustering\n",
    "Let’s start with k-means clustering. A great example of its use is in customer segmentation. Imagine a large retail company with a customer base of thousands. Using k-means, they can segment customers into different groups based on spending patterns, income levels, and demographics. This allows the company to target different customer segments with tailored marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, high-income customers who make frequent purchases might receive exclusive offers, while younger customers with lower spending scores might be targeted with budget-friendly promotions. By grouping customers in this way, companies can create more personalized and effective marketing campaigns."

    "\tDBSCAN\n",
    "Next, let’s talk about DBSCAN in the context of fraud detection in financial services. A major challenge for banks is identifying fraudulent transactions hidden among millions of legitimate ones. DBSCAN is highly effective here because it can detect irregular patterns in transaction data that might indicate fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "By clustering typical transaction patterns, DBSCAN identifies outliers—transactions that don’t fit the normal behavior. These outliers might be unusually large transactions, transactions from unfamiliar locations, or ones that happen at odd times of day. Once flagged, these anomalies can be reviewed by a fraud detection team to ensure the safety of customer accounts."

    "Now, let’s look at PCA and how it’s used in the biotechnology industry, specifically in genomics. Genomics data is often extremely high-dimensional, with thousands of genes and proteins being analyzed simultaneously. To make sense of this data, researchers apply PCA to reduce the number of dimensions while retaining the most important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "By simplifying the data, PCA allows scientists to visualize gene expression patterns, identify groups of genes that behave similarly, and even detect underlying biological processes. This can lead to breakthroughs in understanding diseases like cancer or identifying potential drug targets."

    "t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique primarily used for data visualization.
